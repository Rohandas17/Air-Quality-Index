## Introduction
This project presents a regression model designed to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) value. Using a dataset containing daily AQI readings from various countries, the model leverages a Linear Regression algorithm to forecast AQI based on temporal and categorical features. The workflow includes essential preprocessing steps like date decomposition and one-hot encoding to prepare the data for effective model training.
## Features  
- **Linear Regression Model:** Implements a straightforward and interpretable linear model to predict AQI values.
- **Date-based Feature Engineering:** Decomposes the Date column into Year, Month, and Day to capture temporal patterns in the data.
- **Categorical Data Handling:** Uses one-hot encoding to convert categorical features like Country and Status into a numerical format that the model can process.
